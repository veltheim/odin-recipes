    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>280 g flour</li>
      <li>250 g butter</li>
      <li>100 g brown sugar</li>
      <li>130 g sugar</li>
      <li>2 eggs</li>
      <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
      <li>0.5 tsp salt</li>
      <li>1 packet vanilla sugar</li>
      <li>200 g chocolate</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>This dough is enough for about 20 cookies.</li>
      <li>Beat the butter with both sugars and the salt until light and fluffy. Add the eggs and vanilla sugar and beat until creamy. Set aside some flour and mix it with the baking soda. Stir the remaining flour into the mixture a spoonful at a time, then finally stir in the flour-baking soda mixture. The dough will be relatively firm and chewy. Mix the chocolate, nuts, etc., into the dough.</li>
      <li>Place the dough, tablespoon at a time, onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Leave plenty of space! The cookies will spread quite a bit. Maximum 8 cookies per sheet.</li>
      <li>Bake at 190°C (375°F) for about 8-9 minutes. Important: Depending on your oven, the cookies will be done a little sooner or later. They are perfect when the edges are very lightly browned and the center of the cookies still looks moist.</li>
      <li>Immediately remove them from the oven and carefully place them on a plate or similar surface to cool – they are very fragile. Do not leave them on the hot baking sheet! They will harden as they cool, but will remain nice and soft inside. If they become crispy, they were in the oven too long! It's best to store them refrigerated in a container. They will keep for about 4 days.</li>
      <li>Macadamia White Chocolate Cookies: Stir 200g of coarsely chopped white chocolate and 150g of chopped macadamia nuts into the batter. Rinse salted nuts thoroughly beforehand.</li>
      <li>Double Chocolate Cookies: Stir 150g of chopped dark chocolate and 1 tbsp of dark cocoa powder into the batter.</li>
      <li>Chocolate Walnut Cookies: Stir 150g of coarsely chopped dark chocolate and 100g of coarsely chopped walnuts into the batter.</li>
    </ol>
